            h3 The Goal
            p For this final project, I wanted to make an MVC site to host the simple game I made in Web Apps Dev 1. My goal was to have the game save your high scores for the site to display, so you can see how you do compared to other players.
            p This project has a login/logout system that users can use to log in to the site, in order to save their high scores. You cannot go to any of the pages on the site without an account.
            p There is a page for the game people will play for high scores, as well as a page for the scores themselves. This is the home page (or landing page) and has information about the project on it, for documentation. For the final project, there will also be a page for more extensive documentation, such as the design document originally submitted for the project.
            p The high score page shows you all scores submitted by users of the site. It displays their username as well as the score they got in the game. While I'd like these to be sorted from highest to lowest, I couldn't find a way to do that directly from the database, so the scores are currently displayed without sorting.
